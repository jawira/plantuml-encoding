= PlantUML encoding functions 

*PlantUML* uses a *special encoding* to transform a uml text description like:

----
Bob -> Alice : hello
----

into

----
SyfFKj2rKt3CoKnELR1Io4ZDoSa70000
----

The advantage of the last encoding is that it is easier to use in URL:

To achieve such an encoding, the text diagram is:

* Encoded in UTF-8
* Compressed using Deflate algorithm
* Encoded back in plain ASCII using a transformation close to base64
